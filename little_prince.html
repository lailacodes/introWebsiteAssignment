            As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
            <span class="emotion">I felt deeply moved, and stirred. <span id="assumption"> It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>
                It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. </span>
            In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead,
            his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
            <span class="quotes">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..." </span>
            As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself:
            <span class="quotes"> “What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower —
                the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..." </span>
            And I felt him to be more fragile still. <span class="emotion">I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might
            be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span>
